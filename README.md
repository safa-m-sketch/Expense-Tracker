# Expense-Tracker
Started with the console to plan ideas for the Expense Tracker Project
Through this project, I was able to get familiar with Java Swing and create an application that relates to real-world budgeting tools used in the business world.
I was also able to implement past skills like object-oriented programming

In this program, you can record income, expenses, categories of spending, and the current balance in your account
