# Expense-Tracker
Planned ideas for this project by simply coding in the console.
Through this project, I learn:
- Java Swing
- Real-world applications that relate to real-world budgeting tools used in the business world.
- Past skills in object-oriented programming

In this program, you can record income, expenses, categories of spending, and the current balance in your account
